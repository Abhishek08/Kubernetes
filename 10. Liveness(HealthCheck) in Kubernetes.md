# Kubernetes — Liveness

####  Pods and Container are running but application is might dead because of some reason. To Detect and resolve problem with application we need to use Liveness (Healthcheck)

#### Liveness probes are used to control the health of an application running inside a Pod’s container. 

#### Liveness probe checks the container health as we tell it do, and if for some reason the liveness probe fails, it restarts the container.

#### User can execute 2 types of Liveness 
  
####  1. Running a command in container periodically 
####  2. periodic check on HTTP Request

#### Liveness command example 
```sh 

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  labels:
    test: liveness
  name: liveness-exec
spec:
  containers:
  - name: liveness
    image: k8s.gcr.io/busybox
    args:
    - /bin/sh
    - -c
    - touch /tmp/healthy; sleep 30; rm -rf /tmp/healthy; sleep 600
    livenessProbe:
      exec:
        command:
        - cat
        - /tmp/healthy
      initialDelaySeconds: 3
      periodSeconds: 5


```

#### We are creating a container with name liveness, and as the container initialise we use the following command:


#### to create a file healthy at path /tmp/healthy, and delete it after 30 seconds.

```sh

- touch /tmp/healthy; sleep 30; rm -rf /tmp/healthy; sleep 600
```


#### This commands tell the liveness probe to open file at path /tmp/healthy, and if it can’t the liveness probe will fail and container will restart.
```sh

exec:
  command:
  - cat
  - /tmp/healthy
  
```

#### This is the delay which tells kubelet to wait for 3 seconds before performing the first probe

```sh

initialDelaySeconds: 3

```


#### This field specifies that kubelet should perform a probe every 5 seconds.

```sh

periodSeconds: 5

```
