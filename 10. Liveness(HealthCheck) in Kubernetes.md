# Kubernetes — Liveness

#### Liveness probes are used to control the health of an application running inside a Pod’s container. 

#### Suppose that a Pod is running our application inside a container, but due to some reason let’s say memory leak, cpu usage, application deadlock etc the application is not responding to our requests, and stuck in error state.

#### Liveness probe checks the container health as we tell it do, and if for some reason the liveness probe fails, it restarts the container.
