# ReplicaSet In Kubernets 


#### Replica Set is enhance version of Replication Controller

#### ReplicaSetâ€™s purpose is to maintain a stable set of replica Pods running at any given time.

#### Difference between Replication controller vs ReplicaSet

#### ReplicaSet :- 

Replica Set : Replica Set supports the new set-based selector. This gives more flexibility. 
Ex. environment in (production, qa) This selects all resources with key equal to environment and equal to production or qa

Replication Controller : Replication Controller only supports equality-based selector.
Ex. environment = production
This selects all resources with key equal to environment and value equal to production

#### Operators to use with ReplicaSets

There are three kinds of operator we can use with ReplicaSets:

* In
* Notin
* Exists


#### MatchLabels ReplicaSet Example 

```sh

apiVersion: apps/v1  # our API version
kind: ReplicaSet # # The kind we are creating
metadata: # Specify all Metadata like name, labels
 name: frontend
 labels:
   app: myReplica
spec:
  replicas: 3 # Here is where we tell k8s how many replicas we want
  selector:   # This is our label selector field. 
    matchLabels: 
      app: frontend   # we are using the Equality based operators
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: frontend   
    spec:
      containers:  
        - name: php-redis
          image: gcr.io/google_samples/gb-frontend:v3
